Taking It Further - Chapter 6

Use the new skills you learned in this chapter to build exciting new projects! Here are some suggestions:
* Write a Processing sketch that connects to Twitter and tweets out an announcement every time your Arduino detects movement in your room.
* Use a Leonardo to make a gamepad that enables you to quickly execute key combinations for your favorite video game.
* Use a Leonardo to make a physical lock button for your computer that sends a screen lock key combination when a physical button is pressed.
* Hook up a dozen LEDs to your Arduino and create a Processing GUI to control each of them or to activate different flashing patterns.
* Use Processing to create a graphical display of analog values changing on ADC inputs to your Arduino.
