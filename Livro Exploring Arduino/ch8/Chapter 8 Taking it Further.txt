Taking It Further - Chapter 8

Use I2C devices to enable all kinds of exciting new projects:
* Add an I2C DAC to your Arduino to enable true analog output.
* Add an I2C gyroscope or accelerometer to detect tilting and movement.
* Use an I2C barometric pressure sensor paired with the temperature and light sensors that you’ve already used to make a great weather station.
