Taking It Further - Chapter 9

Use SPI devices to enable all kinds of exciting new projects:
* Add digital accelerometers and gyroscopes as sensors to your project.
* Utilize an SPI high-precision analog-to-digital converter to read analog signals with a higher degree of resolution than the Arduino can do on its own.
* Add an SPI thermocouple chip to facilitate super-accurate temperature measurements.
* Use the audiovisual platform developed in this chapter to build interactive art exhibits with lights and sounds.
